    There are familiar sounds that I often hear, dancing about in the world of my soul. 
Their tunes flow into my ears each time I touch a piece of burnished wood with metal 
strings and while I scan the bold-printed texts of European History books. Images of 
their staggered notes guide me step by step—transforming unmotivated muscles into 
motion and a scattered mind into an ocean of tranquility. Whether it’s a Symphony, 
Concerto, Opera, or Sonata, classical music is behind each door I open, each corner 
I turn, and each memory I recall.
