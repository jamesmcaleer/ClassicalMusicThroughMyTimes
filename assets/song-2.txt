    Once I reached fourteen years of age, I found myself for the fourth time 
passing through a crowded school hallway. Hundreds of other children flooded 
the hallway with a sea of various instruments, all awaiting an uncertain audition 
judge. To distract myself from the immense feeling of anxiety that enveloped my 
body, I whispered to a younger boy next to me in the hall with a cello, ‘What 
piece are you going to perform?’ He answered with a nervous face, “<i>The Swan</i>, 
by Camille Saint-Saëns. You?” ‘<i>Allegro Brillante</i> by William Ten Have,’ I answered 
nervously. I hoped talking with cello-boy would ease my nerves and relieve my 
anxious solitude. However, the storm of anxiety, like always, enveloped my body 
like how clouds envelop the sun. 
    Facing the judge in the audition room was never a calming atmosphere and it 
never got any easier. Piercing eyes watched my every bow stroke, open ears were 
always on alert for my mistakes, and a pencil with paper carefully marked my every 
move. It was the day I dreaded each year since I began playing violin; my least 
favorite part of the music world. This was my final year auditioning for the All 
County Orchestra. I had practiced immensely six months out of the year, drowning 
my body in an abyss of stress, all for a ten-minute audition.
    To my disbelief, I walked into an audition room to discover a small old lady 
sitting with a smile at her desk. It was a most uncommon smile—one that I have been 
unfamiliar with in the music world. After brief introductions, my fingers began 
moving up and down the fingerboard as if possessed. An “A scale” set the tone for 
my audition piece: <i>Allegro Brillante</i>. This time, the judge’s eyes weren’t piercing 
at me, but were absorbing the musicality of my violin. I relaxed my shoulders, easing 
my neck pain while forcefully bowing the fast notes of the piece. It is amazing what 
a kind smile can do.
