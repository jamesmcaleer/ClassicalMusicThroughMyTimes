    The long-awaited day of the All County Concert arrived with the shuffling of 
music cases. Lined up backstage and dressed from head to toe in concert dress, 
the various sections of instruments proudly stood awaiting the grand audience’s 
applause. The concert hall greeted me with its high ceilings and warm lights—a 
warm welcome. Sitting towards the right side of the stage, a sea of various singing 
instruments surrounded me. The majority of our performance consisted of Shostakovich, 
Bruch, and finally, Bizet. I could feel the anticipation of <i>Carmen Overture</i> building 
at the end of Shostakovich’s fourteenth Symphony. 
    Staring at my stand partner James, our fingers pressed the first notes of <i>Carmen 
Overture</i>. Feeling my curiosity heightening, we moved quickly. Page one: <i>turn</i>. Page 2: 
<i>turn</i>. Page 3: <i>pause</i>. The first few notes of “Toreador” awaited our next move. I vividly 
remember looking up from my music stand, my violin clenched in hand, and all eyes ready 
for our conductor’s <i>fortissimo</i> cue. With the forceful drop of our conductor's arms, the 
entire orchestra played the exact staccato notes: <i>ensemblée</i>: Together at the same time. 
The woodwinds chirped like birds, the strings called out to the hall, and the drums 
solidified the steady marching tempo. We were all different sections of instruments 
united as one symphony, speaking the same musical language. The theme of “Toreador” 
rang throughout the hall with a clear flow of fast and slow notes. My ears were soothed 
and my heart was alive with this musical sound. We found our eyes focused on each other 
when playing rather than on the music sheet’s notes. It was a moment that captured 
everyone’s faces in the hall. We were all one, united as a symphony.
