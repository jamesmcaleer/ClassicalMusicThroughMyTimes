    Throughout my college years, a particular classical piece has resonated with 
me—a piece that encourages me to feel those deep and true parts of myself, 
reminding me that I am a confidently free bird with the ability to soar however 
high I wish. This piece is called <i>Symphony No. 4 In A Major</i> by Felix Mendelssohn. 
Mendelssohn has always been one of my favorite composers. I learned a few of his 
pieces back in high school, ultimately falling in love with his <i>Symphony No. 4 In 
A Major</i> because of its upbeat rhythm. Today, when I spontaneously practice its fast 
notes on my violin, I feel as if I am bicycling across the Tuscan countryside of 
Italy, unconfined to a set destination, allowing the wheels to guide me forward. 
    When we allow ourselves to feel in the moment, a new world opens up before us. 
My family friend, Peggy Fitzsimmons is a psychologist and published author of the 
book <i>Release: Create a Clutter Free and Soul Driven Life</i>. In her book, Peggy strongly 
advocates that feeling the world around us will declutter worries from our minds. 
According to Peggy, we can place our minds in the present time simply by looking at a 
color on the wall, listening to music, or touching an object that is in front of us. 
Being that anxiety has always made it difficult for me to stay in the present moment, 
experimenting with Peggy’s recommendations was especially useful before I took the 
Law School Admission Test in October of 2024. 
    The Law School Admission Test is probably the biggest performance I have ever 
endured. When I sat down to take the test, my anxiety transported my mind to the 
all-feared music audition room—a room where I often struggled to feel the vibrations 
of the music. For a moment, all I could think about was my fear of being unable to 
answer the exam questions: <i>Will I be able to focus? Can I do this?</i>
