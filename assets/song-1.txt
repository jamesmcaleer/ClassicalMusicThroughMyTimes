    After teaching me how to hold the violin under my chin and pluck the strings, 
Mr. Kelly asked me, “Have you ever played the violin before?” I responded
hesitantly, “No. But I have played the mandolin a few times.” Mr. Kelly smiled
and said, “The mandolin has the same strings as the violin. The only difference
is that the violin is played with a bow.” I picked up the bow and stared at it 
intently. “Can I try bowing a note?” I asked him. “Yes, please do,” said Mr. Kelly.
At that moment, I wasn’t worried about the noise the instrument would make. It just
felt natural, as if I had done it before. Looking back on this memory, I often 
wonder if I had been a classical musician in a past life. When trying something 
new, the feeling is supposed to feel new. Bowing the violin for the first time 
didn’t feel new. It was as if my muscles already knew how to hold the bow and 
how to play. 

    I played a big “open A” and then placed one finger down on the string to play a
“B.” Suddenly, Mr. Kelly’s eyebrows were glued to the top of his forehead. He walked 
over to his desk and picked up a book entitled “Essential Elements for Strings: 
A Beginner’s Guide to Violin.” Quickly, he flipped through the pages and landed on
a short few measures of notes. The title of the excerpt was called “Jupiter” from 
Gustav Holst’s symphony The Planets. With excitement rising in his voice, Mr. Kelly 
told me the names of each note and where to place my fingers on the fingerboard to 
play them. After three attempts of bowing these slow notes, I had played the entire 
excerpt. I didn’t quite know how many beats each of these notes were at first. 
Nevertheless, the notes sounded triumphant. It was as if the notes were telling the 
story of a squire being knighted by a king—his head bowed down in honor with the 
heavens smiling above.
